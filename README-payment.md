## how treassure nft understand the deposit address from which account the payment is done?

Treasure NFT doesn't directly track or "understand" the sender's account address for payments; instead, the blockchain itself records the transaction, with the sender's wallet address publicly visible on the immutable ledger for any observer to see and verify the payment source. For the buyer, they would initiate a payment by sending funds to the Treasure NFT marketplace's provided deposit address, which is associated with the platform's smart contract for receiving cryptocurrency payments


## Here's how it works:
1. **Blockchain as the Ledger:** <br/>
   NFTs operate on a blockchain, which acts as a public, immutable ledger. Every transaction, including payments, is recorded on this ledger.
2. **Sender's Wallet Address:** <br/>
   When you send a cryptocurrency payment to purchase an NFT, the transaction is associated with your unique wallet address. This address is publicly visible on the blockchain.
3. **Recipient's Deposit Address:** <br/>
   Treasure NFT will provide a specific wallet address (or smart contract address) for you to send the payment to.
4. **Verification of Payment:** <br/>
   The platform can see that a transaction occurred from a specific address to its own designated deposit address on the blockchain. This confirms that a payment was made.
5. **No "Understanding" of "Account":** <br/>
   Treasure NFT doesn't "understand" which account the payment comes from in a human sense. It verifies the transaction by checking the blockchain's public record.
6. **Transfer of Ownership:** <br/>
   Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the ownership of the NFT is transferred to your wallet address

> In essence, you, the buyer, are responsible for ensuring you send the cryptocurrency from your own wallet to the correct deposit address provided by Treasure NFT, and the blockchain serves as the transparent and secure record of that payment. 


### 1. Blockchain Addresses:
A Blockchain Address serves as a unique identifier for sending and receiving cryptocurrency and digital assets on a blockchain network. Think of it as a bank account number for crypto.
### 2. Transaction Data on the Blockchain:
Whenever a cryptocurrency payment is made to a specific address, details about that transfer are added to the blockchain. This information is publicly available and typically includes the amount of cryptocurrency sent, the sender's address, the receiver's address, and the date and time of the transfer.

### 3. Transaction ID (TXID): 
Each transaction is assigned a unique Transaction ID (or TXID), which acts as a digital fingerprint for the transaction.
### 4. Blockchain Explorers: 
Platforms utilize blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum or PolygonScan for Polygon) which are web services that allow users to view data about transactions, smart contracts, and wallet addresses within a blockchain.
### 5. Tracking Transactions: 
To track the origin of a deposit, platforms can use the Transaction ID (TXID) or the deposit address (which is the receiving address for the deposit) to search for the transaction on a blockchain explorer. By doing so, they can find information such as the sender's address, confirming the account from which the payment was initiated. 

In essence, the blockchain itself, with its transparent and immutable record-keeping, allows platforms to trace transactions back to their origin and identify the sending address associated with a deposit.
